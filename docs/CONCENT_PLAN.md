# JC4P Auction â€“ Concept and UX Plans

This document outlines the creative intent, tone, and UX principles for the JC4P NFT auction experience.

---

## ðŸ§  Concept & Intention

This is not just an NFT sale â€” it's a public spectacle, a vibe-first expression of what it means to compete for attention, time, and creative output on the blockchain.

We are auctioning off four hours of JC4P's focused work as a 1-of-1 NFT. This piece is:

* A **social artifact** that embeds your participation in the Farcaster zeitgeist
* A **contractual receipt** for time
* A **status flex** for owning a moment of on-chain influence

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Vibe

The experience should feel like a live public game show or high-stakes crypto trading floor â€” but with aesthetics that reflect JC4Pâ€™s design sensibilities:

* **Loud** but **clean**
* Stark contrast: minimal black-and-white themes with glitch or neon edge accents
* Retro-futurist UI fonts (bitmap style okay)
* Mobile-first, snappy, responsive interactions
* Timer should feel urgent
* Bids should feel like punches
* Every cast or bid is a piece of lore

## ðŸ§­ UX Structure

### Core Pages / Views

1. **Landing / Frame View**

   * Large image of NFT
   * Current high bid + timer
   * Single CTA: "Place Bid"
   * If loading from Farcaster frame, must auto-connect and display FID

2. **Expanded View / Web App**

   * Show:

     * Current highest bidder address + FID
     * First bidder + FID (highlighted, badge?)
     * Countdown timer
     * Last bid amount in ETH
     * Your total bids and your FID (if logged in)
     * Leaderboard optional
     * Optional: bid log (with address and FID per entry)

3. **Post-Auction View**

   * Show winner info (address + FID)
   * Final bid
   * Metadata preview of the NFT
   * Cast link to share results

## ðŸ’¬ Tone of Voice

This isnâ€™t Sothebyâ€™s â€” itâ€™s JC4P. The copy should:

* Be clever but not cringe
* Speak in memes if it feels right
* Respect the stakes of bidding, but joke about them too
* Examples:

  * "Youâ€™re about to buy time itself."
  * "First bidder energy."
  * "Donâ€™t get sniped."

---

## ðŸ“£ On-Chain Identity

Each bidder is not just an address â€” theyâ€™re a **FID**. Surface it. Celebrate it.

* Show their Farcaster profile pic if available (optional)
* Always display address + FID together if possible

---

## ðŸ”® Future Directions

* Turn bidding history into its own castable stream
* Link the NFT to a Frame for redemption of the work session
* Extend the format to other creators for decentralized auctions of time

This app is part utility, part performance art, and part social engagement tool.
Make it beautiful. Make it loud. Make it unforgettable.
